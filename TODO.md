# TODO list for the project
1. Change all TSEL names to TREL inside of the code.
2. Start making the simulation process for the code.
3. Implement transient iteration for functions.
    - `float * iterate_function(start, step, iter, function_pointer);` could be the prototype.
4. Rewrite the testapp in Python (using [ctypes](https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/#ctypes)) this would allow for easier testing and usage examples for users of higher level languages like Python.
